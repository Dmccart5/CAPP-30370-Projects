			<h3>PGA Money List Leaders 2013</h3>
			<ol class="golf">
				<li>Tiger Woods</li>
				<li>Phil Mickelson</li>
				<li>Matt Kuchar</li>
				<li>Brandt Snedeker</li>
				<li>Adam Scott</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Even as Tiger sits atop the money list, he has this to say about his career's future:</p>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>"You always know it's not going to be like this forever. That's just -- it's part of playing sports.
				You're always going to have down cycles. Unfortunately we go through those times. You don't ever want
				to go through them, trust me, it doesn't feel good, but it's just part of playing sport, and especially
				in our sport, longevity is just huge here. You've got a career that could literally span -- for me, 30
				years on the regular Tour. There's no other profession really like that, that you can play at a high level
				for that long. No, you're going to have periods like that. You can't win every tournament."</p>

			<h3>Projected Career Plans</h3>
			<p>	After graduation, I plan on moving back home in Chicago while working for <strong>Brown Brothers Harriman</strong>,
			a New-York based bank and wealth manager most well-known as the oldest privately owned bank in the United States. With my double
			majors in finance and computer applications, I hope to implement what I have learned in my CAPP classes to make my job
			more efficient and effective for our firm <em>and</em> our clients. I feel what I have learned so far has been very
			relevant to my projected career path, and I hope to soak up as much information as I can before the end of my senior
			year.</p>

					<p>This past Tuesday, Apple released the new iPhone 5S and 5C models, corroborating recent speculation and rumors
					regarding a new color scheme as well as the addition of a fingerprint sensor in the 5S. The 5S will retain the same
					price points as past releases, and the 5C will be offered as a lower-cost option in an attempt to capture more 
					overseas market share.</p>
					<p>According to the article, 
						<blockquote><p>"The iPhone 5s includes a new A7 chip, which Apple notes is the first 64-bit chip in a smartphone."</p></blockquote>
