				  <p>New York, 1929. Bond-seller Nick Carraway, in a sanitarium for depression and alcoholism, is persuaded by his doctor to write a therapeutic
				  account of what put him there. Nick's journal describes how, seven years earlier, he had moved to a tiny house on Long Island adjoining the
				  sumptuous mansion owned by enigmatic neighbour, the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby. After attending one of Gatsby's legendary parties, Nick is
				  asked by Gatsby to arrange a meeting with his cousin, Daisy, now married to the brutish and philandering Tom Buchanan, who was Gatsby's true
				  love, prior to war service. As Nick complies he comes to see that Gatsby, once a poor boy, has recreated himself as a fascinating millionaire
				  purely to win Daisy back but the events of a drunken afternoon conspire to bring about an ending which is anything but happy.</p>

				  <h2>Leonardo DiCaprio Biography</h2>

				  <p>Leonardo DiCaprio is an American actor whose portrayal of doomed suitor Jack Dawson in Titanic (1997) made him a generation's definition
				  of a heartthrob. Throughout his career, DiCaprio has demonstrated a high level of dramatic versatility, from his breakout film role as a
				  mentally-challenged teenager in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), through his work with Martin Scorsese in Gangs of New York (2002) and
				  The Departed (2006). More recently, DiCaprio earned critical notice for his starring roles in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) and J.
				  Edgar (2011), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.</p>
	
				  <p>Born in 11 November, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist George DiCaprio and Irmelin
				  DiCaprio. His parents signed him with a talent agent when he was a child, and DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials
				  and educational shows. Although the budding actor had small roles in such TV series as "Roseanne" (1988) and "The New Lassie" (1989), DiCaprio's
				  made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie.</p>
				
					<p>In 1992, DiCaprio joined what became the final season of "Growing Pains" (1985), playing a homeless boy who was invited to move in with the
					Seavers. The sitcom's cancellation coincided with an upswing in his career, including the starring role in the film adaptation of Jim Carroll's
					The Basketball Diaries (1995) and his heightened portrayal of Romeo in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996). Although DiCaprio's Romeo raised his
					profile with audiences, his turn in the box office record-breaking Titanic (1997) graduated the actor to A-list status.</p>
					
					<p>The majority of DiCaprio's post-Titanic career demonstrates a high level of selectivity in his choices. In addition to numerous collaborations
					with Scorsese, DiCaprio has also starred in films directed by Steven Spielberg (Catch Me If You Can (2002), Ridley Scott (Body of Lies (2008),
					and Sam Mendes (Revolutionary Road (2008), in roles that encompass a wide emotional and dramatic range. This continues to be the case, evident 
					in his upcoming film appearances as a mustache-twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), soon to be followed by his performance as tragic
					literary character Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby (2013).</p>
			
					<p>DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same
					year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.</p>
